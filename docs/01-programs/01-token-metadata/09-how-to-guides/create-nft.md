# Create a NFT
This recipie shows how you can mint a NFT using Umi. It assumes that your metadata has already been uploaded and is accessible through a URI.

## Install dependencies.
First of all we need to install the dependencies. For general Umi installation refer the [install recipie](install).
```
npm install @metaplex-foundation/umi \
  @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata@alpha
```
